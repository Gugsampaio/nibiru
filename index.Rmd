# Nibiru {-}

![](imgs/cover.png)

**Nibiru** ([video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBACC2zOlj8)) is a science fiction RPG centred around amnesia and discovery, set in a massive space station known as Nibiru, which serves as a haven for forgotten memories. Players take on the roles of Vagabonds, individuals who have arrived in Nibiru with no memory of their past, and must explore the station and its bizarre societies to uncover their histories and the secrets of this enigmatic world.

#### Themes {-}

- **Memory**: The theme of memory is central, as characters struggle to piece together fragmented memories and uncover the truth about their pasts. Memory serves as both a tool and a barrier, shaping the characters' identities and driving their actions as they explore the mysteries of the Nibiru.
- **Identity**: In a world where characters' memories are unreliable and their true selves are often obscured, characters must navigate the complexities of identity, grappling with questions of who they are and who they want to become in the face of uncertainty and amnesia.
- **Exploration**: Characters' journey through the vast and enigmatic space station known as the Nibiru. As they do, they uncover hidden secrets, encounter strange creatures, and navigate treacherous environments as they explore the depths of the ship and search for answers about its origins and purpose.
