- Meet [VaelenSorra](../npcs/VaelenSorra.md) outside the ruined construction.
- Labyrinthine network of service tunnels and air ducts, interspersed with derelict industrial buildings. 
- Cracked tiles and scattered debris from long-abandoned structures, piles of scrap machinery.
- On the outside:
	- Vast expanse of interlocking metal and synthetic materials, dimly illuminated by the distant glow of Ascendant V.
	- This massive transport vessel occasionally casts its shadow over the area, a reminder of the technological marvels that roam the vast corridors of Nibiru.
	- The ceiling is dotted with flickering lights and the occasional spark from exposed wiring, creating an eerie, perpetually twilight ambiance.
	- The air is filled with a low, constant hum of machinery and the distant echoes of moving transport vessels.
