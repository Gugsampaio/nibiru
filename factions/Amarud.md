# Amarud Clan

The Amarud clan, worked for generations in the construction of the Ascendant V—the massive elevator that connects Ashur with the Umbras beyond.
The clan lostmany to this project, the last of them being [Nabua](../npcs/NabuaAmarud.md)’s mother Mulge, who disappeared thirty cycles ago.
And, now the Primarchy wants Mulge to join the ruling council.
