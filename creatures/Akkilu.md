**Lion**

- **Substenance Source**: Biocircuits
- **Localization**: Umbra
- **Length**: 2 meters
- **Weight**: 110 kilos

Since the dawn of humanity, lions have been looked at with respect and reverence—walking representations of all that’s glorious, proud, and free. Some of the cults of dawn regard them as rulers over all other living things. The Assyrian refer to the term “lionesque” as the ideal of what a people should aspire to be like. The truth is, there’s more to the term—and the actual species—than that. Relentless, merciless; that is all part of the lion’s nature as well. And surely, the same can be said of the aforementioned peoples.

Lions lack the organs that other Lawû use to take energy directly from Nibiru’s power lines. The Akkilu’s nervous terminations, instead, are sensitive organs that can only tolerate the amperage of other biocircuits. This is the main reason why lions hunt for prey, with their bodies perfectly adapted for this lifestyle. They can detect weakened energy signatures at great distances, chasing after them to tire them before pouncing on them. Solitary lions will generally chase smaller prey, while packs have been seen preying on creatures as large as webworms.

The Assyrian kings of old used to hunt lions as part of their coronation rituals. Their name is whispered to come from a time before time when the ancestors of earlier flickers engraved on the walls of Nibiru their encounter with these proud species—a token of the admiration and awe born of the meeting between humanity and the wild.

**Tale-Sparks**

1. A strange disease is plaguing the local Akkilu population, turning their skins black. You are asked for help to track down, separate from the pack, and capture a specimen to study.
2. An exiled ex-member of the Assyrian nobility, who’s at the helm of a local scavenger band, has been seen hunting lions for sport. You must stop them to bring an end to the killings.
